# Some things about testing

1. Make your test data readable for human.
  It realy good if your code can be part of documentation.

2. It is important to feel balance between unit and integration testing.
3. Write minimum of needed amount of tests. It needs to think twice before test writing is it really useful in future.

4. Red-Green-Refactoring. By my opinion "Refactoring" part of cycle can/should delete some part of tests written before.
